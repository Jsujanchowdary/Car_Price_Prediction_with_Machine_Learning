# Car_Price_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning
Description:

The "Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning" project is a comprehensive demonstration of applying various machine learning algorithms to predict car prices based on a set of features. The project explores the process of preparing and analyzing data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance. It serves as an excellent starting point for individuals interested in understanding and practicing machine learning techniques for regression tasks.

About the Project:

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. The price of a car is influenced by numerous factors, such as brand reputation, features, engine specifications, and fuel efficiency. Machine learning offers a powerful approach to model these relationships and make accurate price predictions. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

Key Components:

Data Preprocessing:
The project begins by loading and preparing the dataset. It selects relevant features that can influence car prices, such as symboling, dimensions, weight, engine characteristics, and mileage. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module. The data is also standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling of features across different algorithms.

Modeling with Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting:
The initial approach involves using the DecisionTreeRegressor from the sklearn.tree module to build a decision tree-based regression model. Additionally, a more advanced technique, Gradient Boosting, is employed using the GradientBoostingRegressor from the sklearn.ensemble module. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the models' performance.

Neural Network Model with TensorFlow/Keras:
The project also demonstrates building a neural network model using the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. A simple neural network architecture is defined, comprising input, hidden, and output layers. The model is compiled with the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer. The neural network is trained on standardized data and evaluated using the MAE metric.

XGBoost and LightGBM Models:
To further explore ensemble methods, the project introduces XGBoost and LightGBM, which are gradient boosting libraries designed for efficiency and performance. Both models are trained on the data, and their prediction performance is evaluated using MAE.

Ridge and Lasso Regression:
The project also delves into linear regression techniques by applying Ridge and Lasso regression models. These models use regularization to control overfitting and improve generalization. The features are standardized, and different values of the regularization parameter (alpha) are tested to achieve optimal results. The MAE metric is again used to evaluate performance.
